    The way E+ json is structured:

    - the lowest branch on the json tree is the epobject
    - once you are in the epobject:
        - the epobject will not know:
            1. Its own name
            2. the type of object it is
        - it will know only its own fields

    We add two new keys to the epobject that will
    let it store its name and object type
    These names start with `eppy` to make it clear that
    eppy300 has added them

    - eppykey -> stores the E+ object type (epkey)
    - eppyname -> stores the name of the object. its key in E+ json

    Parameters
    ----------
    epmunch: eppy3000.epMunch.EPMunch
