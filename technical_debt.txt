Technical debt
--------------

Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement changes. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt
